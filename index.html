        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a web developer with nearly 10 years of experience building web applications using PHP, Laravel, MySQL, and CMSs such as WordPress. I began my career as a network and database administrator at companies like Caracol SA, where I also developed small-scale applications for departments such as Human Resources and Sales. After that, I spent about two years as a freelancer, delivering tailored solutions for diverse clients. Seeking to broaden my skills and international exposure, I transitioned to remote work, joining ABC Hosting as a web developer. Since then, I have worked with various companies, gaining valuable international experience.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Currently, my primary focus is my full-time role as a web developer, where I strive to create robust and scalable solutions. Occasionally, I take on freelance projects that align with my expertise and schedule, ensuring they complement rather than interfere with my main responsibilities. This approach allows me to stay adaptable while maintaining a strong commitment to my profession.
        </p>
        <p>
            I value efficiency, innovation, and the ability to strike a healthy balance between my career and family life.
